-- Gravity Forms -- 
Build a gravity form using any standard form field you require. 

This add-on supports both standard data collection fields ( such as a text box ), and pricing fields that effect the price.  If you would like to use pricing fields on your form, build a Gravity Form with a Product Field and a Total field. Typically you will set the Product Field to be hidden and set the price to 0.  You would then use additional pricing fields to modify the price of the item as options are selected.    If you are building a donation style form, you can use the product field and allow a user defined price.  

If you are building a Gravity Form that includes pricing fields, you can add the css class of hidden-total to the total field on the gravity form to hide this line item.  WooCommerce-Gravity Forms includes a built in function that will display the total of the customizations selected on the gravity form when a user is adding the item to their cart. 

-- WooCommerce --
WooCommerce 2.4 or greater is required, WooCommerce 2.7 or greater is recommended.

Grouped products are not supported.

On the product admin screen you will see a Gravity Forms meta box.  This meta box allows you to choose the gravity form to be linked to the product as well as configure various display options for the form.
